<p>
    There is a lot I hope to get out of this class. What I want most is a love of learning.
    C# is nice, but I'm not sure if I'm going to use it for the rest of my life. Pehaps I'll get a job
    that works in a different language or way. What I do know for sure is that I'll be learning. That
    is why I chose this major, because I love to learn.
</p>
<p>Top 3 jobs I'm interested in:</p>
<ul>
    <li>PhD student/Research professor</li>
    <li>Data analyst, Business intelligence</li>
    <li>CEO/entreprenuership</li>
</ul>
